### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer science graduate with an interest in computational biology. I've done all sorts of projects during my university days and during my various internships. (Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avaspataru/) for more on where I've been)

I am very passionate about Software Engineering and therefore have participated in hackathons and built a couple of cool side projects you can see here. Even though I get super excited about software just because of how awesome the building part is, I also try to ensure that my projects can do some good! I'm currently working on projects which make computational biology more accessible and help people collaborate on important problems.  

Do not hesitate to contact me about any projects you think I might be able to help out with or collaborate on. I'm always looking forward to new exciting challenges!!
