### Hi there 👋

I am a computer science graduate with an interest in both **software engineering** and **computational biology**. 

I have participated in hackathons and built a couple of cool side projects you can see here. Even though I get super excited about software just because of how awesome the building part is, I also try to ensure that what I code can *do some good*! I'm currently working on projects which make computational biology more accessible and help people collaborate on important problems.  

Do not hesitate to contact me about anything you think I might be able to help out with or collaborate on. I'm always looking forward to new exciting challenges!!
